# Repository Archiving Guidelines

This document outlines the guidelines for archiving repositories in this GitHub account.

## When to Archive a Repository

A repository should be considered for archiving when:

1. **Completed Course Projects**: Projects developed as part of a course or training program that are no longer being enhanced.

2. **Obsolete Technologies**: Projects built with technologies that are now deprecated or no longer in use.

3. **Concept Prototypes**: Initial project concepts that were never fully developed or were superseded by other projects.

4. **Abandoned Projects**: Projects that have not been updated for over 2 years and have no planned future updates.

5. **Training/Example Repositories**: Repositories created for learning purposes that are no longer needed for active reference.

## Archive Process

When archiving a repository:

1. **Update README**: Add an [ARCHIVED] notice to the repository README that explains:
   - Why it's being archived
   - When it was archived
   - Where to find any successor projects (if applicable)

2. **Update the Archive Index**: Add the repository to the [Archive Index](https://github.com/yonatangross/Archive-Index).

3. **Archive the Repository**: Use GitHub's archive feature to set the repository to a read-only state.

## Benefits of Archiving

- **Portfolio Organization**: Keeps your active projects separate from completed or abandoned work
- **Project History**: Preserves the work for reference and portfolio purposes
- **Clear Status**: Makes it clear to visitors which projects are active versus historical
- **Reduced Noise**: Helps focus on current projects while maintaining access to past work

## How to View Archived Projects

Archived projects remain publicly visible (unless they were private) but are clearly marked as archived on GitHub. They can be viewed and cloned, but not modified.
